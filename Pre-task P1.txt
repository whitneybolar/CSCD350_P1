In some classes, The description says to "load" the definition, what does that mean?

Will we need to add the field definitions to the code, or will the client already have that when it's time to compile?

Do all custom data fields need getter and setters?

Do we need to create factory objects, where we will have to reference a class from another class using abstract interfaces?  

Do we need to define classes for simple data types? like Altitude which only contains 1 double
